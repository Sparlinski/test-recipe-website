        <h1>Duo's Meal Time Recipes</h1>

    <p> Meal time is a special time. Our days can be crazy and stressfull, between jobs, responsibilities and life in general! But meal 
        time gives us a moment in our days to sit, relax and focus on the values of life. A welcomed resprite to the pace of a day, a 
        chance to recharge and replenish, an exploration of the senses. It also provides us the opportunity to slow down and sit with the 
        people in our lives. They can be friend, a college, family members or a loved one. Dinner provides the opportunity to connect to 
        our fellow human. They give us the opportunity to listen, or to be heard, to check in or reconnect. Food has a wonderful way of 
        providing a duality of experience and connection that coaleses with a cohesion of flavours and correct preperation. 
        I love to cook and wanted to share with you some of the meals that connect me to the wonderful values that meal time can offer.  </p>
