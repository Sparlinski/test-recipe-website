        <p>This creamy delicous curry is easy and simple to make. Curry powders are wide and varied in the dynamics they bring to a dish.
            If you have access to a local indian market, I highly recommend picking up a powder that you can get there, it will not only 
            enhance the flavor of the dish but you can also bring a level of heat to the dish that you cannot get from standard store 
            bought curry powders. Regardless, the spices and flavors that are combined here will be unleashed regardless of the powder you 
            choose.</p>
